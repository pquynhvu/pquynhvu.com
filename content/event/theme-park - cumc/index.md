abstract: 'COVID-19 is a contagious disease that results from the novel strain of coronavirus. Since the first interhuman transmission case reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, it has caused widespread disruption to businesses worldwide, particularly tourism and hospitality industries. Mitigating the epidemic and reducing fatalities requires answers to critical questions on airborne and surface transmission as well as the efficacy of
antiviral pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. Due to a robust vaccination rollout, the province of Ontario has begun reopening including the opening of Canadaâ€™s Wonderland at limited capacity.'
