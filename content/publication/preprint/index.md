abstract: Model checking is a fundamental aspect of statistical analysis. It is widely acknowledged that the challenges of model checking are heightened when dealing with censored data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that integrates the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the beta-Stacy process, and the relative belief ratio inferences to craft a novel method for model validation. Importantly, this method is adaptable for both complete and right-censored data. We have developed several theoretical results related to this approach. We present a computational algorithm to implement this approach and support its effectiveness with a series of data analysis examples, demonstrating its outstanding performance.
